## Development Progress
- [x] Day 1: On the day 1, I have created the player movement and camera following the player script.
- [x] Day 2: Created an obstackle with a script for detecting the collision between player and the obstackles. 
- [x] Day 3: Added a game over UI and a button to restart the game with a game over script which stops the game after player collides with the obstackle.
